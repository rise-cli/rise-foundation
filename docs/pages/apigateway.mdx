# Api Gateway

## Introduction

Api Gateway creates api endpoints, and allows you to connect other aws resources such as lambda
functions or step functions.

## apigateway.cf.makeLambdaEndpoint

This generates cloudformation for a very specific usecase. It is meant for applications
that only need 1 endpoint and will attach a single general purpose lambda to that endpoint. This
endpoint will only respond to POST http methods.

```ts
import rise from 'rise-foundation'
const endpointCloudformation = rise.apigateway.cf.makeLambdaEndpoint({
    endpointName: 'MyEndpoint',
    lambdaName: 'LambdaName', // This refers to the lambdas CloudFormation ID that is given in the template.
    stage: 'dev',
    path: 'graphql'
})
```

## apigateway.cf.makeLambdaGetEndpoint

This generates cloudformation for a very specific usecase. It is meant for applications
that only need 1 endpoint and will attach a single general purpose lambda to that endpoint. This
endpoint will only respond to GET http methods.

```ts
import rise from 'rise-foundation'
const endpointCloudformation = rise.apigateway.cf.makeLambdaGetEndpoint({
    endpointName: 'MyEndpoint',
    lambdaName: 'LambdaName', // This refers to the lambdas CloudFormation ID that is given in the template.
    stage: 'dev',
    path: 'graphql'
})
```
